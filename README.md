# University Matcher

A comprehensive tool for matching students with universities based on multiple criteria including academic performance, budget constraints, geographic preferences, and career goals.

## Features

- **Intelligent Matching Algorithm**: Find universities that match your academic profile, budget, location preferences, and career goals
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Compare universities across key metrics with customizable weights
- **Visualization Tools**: View comparison charts and radar plots to better understand your options
- **Detailed Reports**: Get in-depth information about each university match

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
